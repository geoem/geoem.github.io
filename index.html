		<section>
			<p>I' am a Dr. Civil Engineer. I received my Ph.D. from the School of Civil Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) in 2014. My doctoral dissertation was awarded by the Greek Association of Computational Mechanics (GRACM) as the best PhD Thesis in 2014 in Computational Methods in Applied Sciences and Engineering. Earlier, I received my Master of Science in "Analysis and Design of Earthquake Resistant Structures (ADERS)" from the School of Civil Engineering of the NTUA, Greece.</p>

			<p>My research interests lie in computational mechanics field. More specific in stochastic finite element method and structural optimization, in linear &amp; nonlinear finite element analysis of structures, in failure mechanics, in finite element technology (XFEM) for crack analysis, etc. I have participated, as an early-stage researcher, in many research projects funded by EU and Greek Organizations and I have also taught in various under- &amp; post-graduate courses at NTUA. </p>
